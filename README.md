# Analyze-A/B-Test-Results

## Overview
A/B tests are commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists to evaluate the effectiveness of different strategies or designs. In this project, you will analyze the results of an A/B test conducted by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page with the aim of increasing user conversions, defined as the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. Your objective is to work through the provided notebook to help the company determine whether they should implement the new page, retain the old page, or continue the experiment for a longer duration to make an informed decision.

## Dataset and Notebook
The dataset and accompanying Jupyter notebook are provided for you to perform the analysis. The notebook contains the necessary instructions and code to guide you through the analysis process. You will be working with the data to assess the performance of the new web page compared to the old page, considering various metrics and statistical tests.

## Project Goals
Your goals for this project include:

1. Understanding the provided dataset and the structure of the A/B test.
2. Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the data.
3. Performing hypothesis testing to assess the statistical significance of the results.
4. Analyzing the results and making recommendations based on the findings.

## Conclusion
The Analyze-A/B-Test-Results project provides an opportunity to apply your skills in analyzing A/B test results. By evaluating the performance of the new web page and comparing it to the old page, you can provide valuable insights and recommendations to the company. Follow the instructions and code provided in the notebook to guide your analysis. Consider statistical significance, metrics, and exploratory data analysis to make an informed decision regarding the implementation of the new page.
